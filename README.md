# Node Clean

Global CLI utility for removing those pesky node_module folders.

```
npm install @bpleco/nodeclean -g
```

Documentation coming in future release, this release in for experimental purposes only.

It does work, if you want to install and run `nodeclean -h` to teach yourself how to use it.
